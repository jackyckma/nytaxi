##Charter Statement
The project is to build a data-science-analytics portal for NYC Taxi which aims to improve the utilization of taxi drivers and the satisfaction of passengers.

###Project purpose
**Why it is important?**

NYC Taxi is facing fierce competition from Uber. Uber attracts a lot of passengers through its innovative service, but it will do no good to the passengers in the long run if Taxi has been totally driven out of the market leaving Uber as the monopolist. Therefore, it is important to help the taxi drivers to stay competitive to maintain a healthy market in order to maximize the benefits of customers.

**What will it try to solve?**

While competitiveness comprise of a lot of different factors, one of the major factors that the Taxi drivers are in significant disadvantaged is the difference in technology.

It is well-known that heavy use of data science analytics is critical for Uber to excel in operation efficiency and customer satisfaction. The project aims to narrow the ¡utechnology gap¡v by building a data science analytics portal for NYC Taxi, which will provide useful analytics for Taxi drivers to reduce their idle time and for passengers to better estimate their trip duration in advance.

**What will be different when the project completes?**

The portal, with its data science analytics engine, will provide prediction on: - Demands for taxi at different locations 
- Estimates of trip durations

The demand prediction can help taxi drivers to decide staying at or heading to locations where demand is high, in order to archive higher utilization. The estimates of trip durations can help drivers and passengers to have better time management, and results in higher passenger satisfaction. Both will contribute to the competitiveness of NYC Taxi drivers against the threat of Uber.
